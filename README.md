## Project Overview

This chatbot project is designed to create a conversational user interface using Java Swing, implementing object-oriented programming principles (OOPs). The chatbot can fetch and respond to user queries using a MySQL database through JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). In cases where the database lacks relevant answers, the chatbot can fetch information from Google.

The project encompasses various features, including a user-friendly graphical interface, a well-structured database, and seamless communication with external sources. This README provides essential information for setting up, using, and contributing to the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **MySQL Database**: You must have a MySQL server installed and running. Create a database and configure it for the chatbot.

- **Java Swing**: Basic knowledge of Java Swing is recommended to understand and customize the user interface.

- **Google URL**: To use Google for fetching information.

- **JDBC Driver**: Download and include the MySQL JDBC driver in your project. You can find it at [MySQL's official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-project.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

3. Import the necessary libraries, including the MySQL JDBC driver.

4. Configure your database connection by modifying the database connection parameters in the `ChatbotDatabase.java` file.


## Usage

1. Run the project.

2. The Java Swing user interface will open, allowing users to interact with the chatbot.

3. Enter a question, and the chatbot will first check the local database for answers. If the answer is not found, it will use the Google API to search for relevant information.

4. The chatbot will display the response in the UI.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/` directory: Contains the Java source code for the chatbot project.
  - `Chatbot.java`: The main class responsible for the chatbot's functionality.
  - `ChatbotDatabase.java`: Manages the database connection and queries.
  - `GoogleSearch.java`: Fetches information from Google using the API key.
  - Other Java files for the Swing-based UI components.

- `lib/` directory: This is where you should place external libraries, including the MySQL JDBC driver.

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.


## Features

- User-friendly Java Swing-based graphical user interface.
- Object-oriented programming principles for code organization and maintainability.
- Database connectivity using MySQL and JDBC for efficient data retrieval.
- Integration with Google for fetching answers not available in the local database.
